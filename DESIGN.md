# Uppadar Hollie implementation contract

This project uses the exact **Modern Luxury Staycation** visual preset exported from Google Stitch: editorial warm minimalism, refined glass surfaces, champagne-gold actions, espresso text, creamy ivory canvas, EB Garamond display typography, and Plus Jakarta Sans interface typography.

## Explore screen

The mobile PWA composition follows the Stitch screen in this order: compact brand/status header, install prompt, online state, photographic hero with overlaid location and facts, paired reservation actions, horizontally browsable space gallery, stay configurations, comfort grid, Cebu address, reservation lookup, and a persistent five-item bottom navigation with an elevated Book action.

## Booking screen

The booking route follows the second Stitch node: Step 1 of 3 progress indicator, live-availability overline, suite selection cards, public calendar with Open/Selected/Pending/Booked states, guest and stay details, visual room tiles, transparent reservation summary, offline-draft notice, Messenger option, and direct-request CTA.

## Admin overview screen

The host workspace follows Stitch node `1b558b13939a4a2483ea9512af241583`: a compact Uppadar brand and live-sync header, quick operational actions, a clear unit-status hero, an operations pulse, financial summary cards, guest pipeline cards, and a persistent mobile navigation. SnowAZ names, IoT controls, figures, and fictional guests shown in the Stitch mockup are reference content only and must never appear in production.

## Admin calendar screen

The admin calendar follows Stitch node `6fa982f15d314d309de8cc5e90dd7077`: month and Today controls, occupancy and stay summaries, room filters, a dense seven-column calendar, explicit Open/Request/Confirmed states, and contextual reservation details. The desktop layout expands the same hierarchy without changing the mobile-first ordering.

## Admin responsive behavior

- Mobile under 768px: compact host header, horizontally scrollable filters, dense calendar cells, stacked operational cards, and fixed five-item bottom navigation.
- Tablet 768–1023px: two-column operational cards with calendar controls kept on one row.
- Desktop 1024px and above: persistent dark espresso sidebar, wide content canvas, four-column pulse cards, and full booking detail panels.
- Admin screens use only Uppadar Hollie terminology and live database values. Internal legacy database function names are implementation details and are never rendered.

## Responsive behavior

- Mobile under 768px: one-column cards, edge-to-edge imagery, 20px page margin, 48–72px section rhythm, fixed glass bottom navigation with safe-area padding.
- Tablet 768–1023px: two-column cards and visible horizontal-scroll cues.
- Desktop 1024px and above: 12-column fluid layout, asymmetrical editorial compositions, maximum content width 1280px.

## Component states

- Primary actions use `#BE8A45`, white text, full-pill geometry, and a restrained warm shadow.
- Fields use cream surfaces, an 8px radius, subtle charcoal border, and a gold focus ring.
- Selected calendar endpoints are solid gold; range dates use the warm-sand fill; pending and booked states remain clearly distinguishable without exposing guest data.
- Elevated cards use a 1px warm-gold/charcoal hairline and soft ambient shadow, never harsh black elevation.

## Content rule

The design and interaction hierarchy mirror the Stitch nodes. SnowAZ business data in the source mockup is reference content only. Uppadar Hollie names, images, room details, Facebook contact, address, pricing, occupancy, policies, and payment terms must come only from confirmed Uppadar Hollie data. Unconfirmed prices display **Ask host** rather than copied SnowAZ rates.

## Accessibility

Maintain semantic landmarks and headings, useful image alternatives, visible keyboard focus, minimum 44px touch targets, form labels, status text in addition to color, and reduced-motion compatibility.

## Supplied Stitch source exports

The user supplied the rendered HTML exports used as the exact source reference:

- `C:/Users/Welmar/.codex/attachments/f08d0f6f-3343-4621-85dd-d2ee9434bead/pasted-text.txt` — host overview screen.
- `C:/Users/Welmar/.codex/attachments/53e8544b-5671-487d-81ed-760309d08965/pasted-text.txt` — host calendar screen.

Preserve the exported composition: fixed translucent cream header, live-sync row, quick actions, sanctuary card, dense calendar/filter panel, floating primary action, and fixed five-item bottom navigation. Exact visual tokens are `#fcf9f3` surface, `#f6f1ea` ivory, `#be8a45` primary container, `#9a6b2d` deep gold, `#1c1b18` charcoal, and `#827567` outline, with Plus Jakarta Sans for UI and EB Garamond for display headings. Replace SnowAZ text and sample data with Uppadar Hollie data.

Additional customer-facing source exports supplied by the user:

- `C:/Users/Welmar/.codex/attachments/8a4b960a-c5f9-497a-b633-a8d5a29e4dd4/pasted-text.txt` — customer Explore/property page.
- `C:/Users/Welmar/.codex/attachments/d22f0103-7331-4889-9700-49e30baf8885/pasted-text.txt` — customer Reserve Your Sanctuary booking page.

These customer exports are separate from the host overview and host calendar exports above. Their bottom navigation is Explore, Bedrooms, Book, Amenities, and Host; it must not be reused as the admin navigation.
